Server-side notes:
The server was build on ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017, so you need the .NET Core installed on your Visual Studio to build the server.

I used Swagger for fast documentation and testing of the interface of the API, 
when start the server you will be presented with documentation page.

Implemented Minimax algorithm for the computer player for minimizing the possible loss of worst case scenario.

Client-side notes:
Implemented with Vue.js and vue-resource.
Just open index.html with any web browser to play.
Remind to start the server and change the server constant in app.js to match the server port if needed.
